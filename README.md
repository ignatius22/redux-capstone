# Redux Capstone

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It is a real-world-like project built with business specifications This project was at the end of the React and Redux curriculum section. For this project, I created an app that allows you to make call to a public api and fetch list of chichen. The use of redux was implemented to manage state and and connect the store with the component using the provider method from the redux.
